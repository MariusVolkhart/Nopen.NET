# Nope'n.NET!

A Roslyn analyzer which requires that classes be `sealed`, `abstract`, or attributed with
`[Open]`.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/MariusVolkhart/Nopen.NET/_apis/build/status/MariusVolkhart.Nopen.NET?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/MariusVolkhart/Nopen.NET/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master)

## Usage

C# creates new types as open by default which can be dangerous. This analyzer ensures that the
intent to leave a class open is explicitly declared.

```csharp
using using Nopen.NET.Attributes;

sealed class Foo {}
abstract class Bar {}
[Open] class Baz {}
```

Non-`sealed`, non-`abstract` classes without the `[Open]` attribute will be marked with an error.

```csharp
class Bad {}
```
```
Bad.cs(1,1): error Nopen: Class 'Bad' is implicitly open. Classes should be explicitly marked sealed, abstract, or [Open].
```

For more information see Item 19 of Effective Java, Third Edition.
